# Taniya-MSc-Assignment-Scripts
##Introduction
This folder contains scripts and reports for six of the eight modules Taniya did in her MSc. The module names are: Introduction to Bioinformatics using Python, Exploratory Data Analysis and Essential Statistics using R, Application of Bioinformatics in Epigenetics, Proteomics and Metagenomics, Next Generation Sequencing Informatics, Machine Learning for Metabolomics, Programming Using Java. The README file will briefly describe the bioinformatics problem Taniya was expected to solve for each of her six assignments.
###Introduction to Bioinformatics using Python
Taniya was required to parse FastQC reoprt file and perform QC visualisation using Python programming language. Also, she had to create Python modules for each QC parameter for FastQC report. The modules were tested by running in the command line with appropiate flages and generating an output file.
###Exploratory Data Analysis and Essential Statistics using R
In this module, Taniya had to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on given files. She had to perform tasks like ANOVA, PCA, different smoothing techniques, create histograms to visualise the data, create different plots for EDA. In her reoprt, she had to interpret all the graph she had produced with appropiate reasoning.
###Next Generation Sequencing Informatics
Taniya had to analyse transcriptomic datasets of potato, and find out regions of potato genome which were responsible for breaking of early dormancy in potato and premature sprouting, which is the reason of spoilage of crop harvests every year. She had to produce a report stating all her results and their interpretation. She used tools such as HISAT, Bowtie, SNPEff, FASTC, Trimmomatic etc.
###Application of Bioinformatics in Epigenetics, Proteomics and Metagenomics
